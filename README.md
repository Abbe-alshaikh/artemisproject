# artemisproject
This repository is beneficial for anyone working with UART communication or similar serial interfaces, providing practical examples of how to handle data transmission, reception, and error rate calculations. It can also serve as a base for those wishing to implement more complex communication systems or protocols.

This repository is organized as follows:

Echo Communication Scripts: Implements a basic echo communication system.
JSON Data Exchange Scripts: Simulates the exchange of JSON data between a sensor and a gateway.
Bit Error Rate Testing Scripts: Conducts bit error rate testing at different baud rates.
Sample JSON Data: Includes artificially created JSON files representing anticipated sensor data and gateway instructions.
